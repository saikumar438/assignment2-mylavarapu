###### Chicken Biryani ######

Biryani is altogether a bowl of full meal consisting **carbohydrates (rice)**, **proteins** and **fibre(meat)**. It has potential to fulfill all the requirements of a full meal single handedly. It's colourful appearance, rich garnishing , great aroma, mouth watering taste makes it more tempting. Tasty masala and juicy meat are the showstoppers, and they decide the taste of biryani. These are the reasons why I like biryani.
